VS Code Web Homepage – Static Build with Vite.js
This project is a custom-built static version of the VS Code web homepage, developed as part of my learning journey through the 100x Devs by Harkirat Singh (Web + DevOps) course.

Unlike a direct clone, every line of code here is hand-written. The structure is built with HTML, CSS, and Vite.js, where I experimented and discovered a background character wave animation, adding a unique, lively feel to the page.

I’ve also given the design a light AI-inspired vibe – subtle elements shaped with the help of modern AI tools – but the process was still exhausting yet incredibly encouraging, pushing my coding skills to the next level.

Features
Static HTML & CSS architecture.

Custom animations (wave background).

Fast dev environment powered by Vite.js.

Minimal yet modern design.

Why This Project?
This project started as an exploration of front-end foundations + DevOps fundamentals while learning in the 100x Devs course. It’s not about copying but understanding the craft of building clean UI from scratch, while sprinkling in personal creativity.

Next Steps
Add responsiveness for all screen sizes.

Experiment with AI-driven UI tweaks.

Deploy using modern DevOps pipelines.
