# VS Code Web Homepage – Static Build with Vite.js

## 📝 About the Project
This project is a **custom-built static version of the VS Code web homepage**, created during my learning journey with the **[100x Devs (Web + DevOps) by Harkirat Singh](https://100xdevs.com/)** course.  

Unlike cloning, **this is hand-coded from scratch** using **HTML, CSS, and Vite.js**.  
A highlight of the project is the **background character wave animation**, which I discovered and implemented to give the page a unique, dynamic feel.  

There’s also a **subtle touch of AI tools** that helped in design ideation, but the process was still **exhausting yet rewarding**, pushing my coding skills further.
